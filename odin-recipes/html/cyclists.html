        <p>Wout is by far the cutest- uh, coolest rider in the peloton!</p>
        <p>A sprinter by trade, Wout's versatility, and his ability to perform in, and take victory on, almost any kind of stage has earned him the rather unique <b>Rider Type</b> of <i>Stage Hunter.</i></p>

        <p>A selfless warrior of the road, van Aert has proven time and time again that his commitment to his teammates, and to the organisation with which he rides, is at the core of his personality; he recently signed a lifetime contract with Visma | Lease a Bike.</p>

        <h4 class="yellow">General Classification, <span class="white">Climber</span></h4>

        <p>Kasia Niewiadoma is such an exciting rider to watch. She’s Polish and races for CANYON//SRAM Racing as their leader since 2018. Her specialty is climbing - she is always at her best on those brutal, mountainous courses.</p>
        <p>This year has been massive for her. She won the 2024 Tour de France Femmes avec Zwift, putting in an epic ride on Alpe d’Huez to secure the overall title. Earlier in the season, she also won La Flèche Wallonne Féminine, which is a huge deal because it’s one of the most prestigious one-day races, and she became the first Polish woman to take that title!</p>
        <p>She’s been super consistent throughout her career—last year, she won the Mountains Classification jersey at the Tour de France Femmes and even picked up the Gravel World Championship title. Honestly, her tenacity and attacking style make her one of the most fun riders to follow! </p>

        <h4 class="yellow">Time Trial Specialist, <span class="white">Classics Rider</span></h4>
    
        <p>Victor Campenaerts is a Belgian powerhouse best known for his expertise in time trials and his innovative approach to aerodynamics. Racing with Lotto–Dstny, he’s constantly evolving his style to excel in both individual efforts and grueling one-day classics.</p>
        <p>Back in 2019, he shattered the Hour Record, covering an astonishing 55.089 km, which remains the highlight of his career. This year, Victor has shown his versatility, with a standout performance in the Tour de France’s Stage 18, where he led a daring breakaway with teammate Pascal Eenkhoorn. They nearly pulled off the unthinkable on a flat stage, a feat still talked about by cycling fans.</p>
        <p>He’s not just about the past, though. Recently, he claimed victory at the Druivenkoers Overijse by mastering its challenging hilly terrain. As a key part of Lotto–Dstny’s strategy for the Spring Classics, Victor’s tactical nous and sheer grit make him a rider to watch in any race.</p>
