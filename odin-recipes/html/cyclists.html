        <p>Wout is by far the cutest- uh, coolest rider in the peloton!</p>
        <p>A sprinter by trade, Wout's versatility, and his ability to perform in, and take victory on, almost any kind of stage has earned him the rather unique <b>Rider Type</b> of <i>Stage Hunter.</i></p>

        <p>A selfless warrior of the road, van Aert has proven time and time again that his commitment to his teammates, and to the organisation with which he rides, is at the core of his personality; he recently signed a lifetime contract with Visma | Lease a Bike.</p>
